The best book I ever read about testing and best practices in an Agile project is: Agile Testing: A Practical Guide for Testers and Agile Teams (Addison-Wesley Signature)

The main idea of Agility is constantly giving and receiving *feedback* in order to keep improving the process and the output of the project.
