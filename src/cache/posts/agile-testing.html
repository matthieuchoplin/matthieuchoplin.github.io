<p>The best book I ever read about testing and best practices in an Agile project is: Agile Testing: A Practical Guide for Testers and Agile Teams (Addison-Wesley Signature)</p>
<p>The main idea of Agility is constantly giving and receiving <em>feedback</em> in order to keep improving the process and the output of the project.</p>
