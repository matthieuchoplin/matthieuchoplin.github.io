<p>As the number of posts is growing, I think that having a search engine within the website is now relevant. This post only shows what I am using for that.</p>
<p>Instead of using an external search engine such as Google or DuckDuckGo, you have a plugin in Nikola than enables searching on the client side by using jQuery.</p>
<p>Assuming you have installed Nikola &gt; v7.0, you can install the plugin like this:</p>
<pre class="code python"><a name="rest_code_68fb8774c40042d88c4f57ed372a9962-1"></a><span class="n">nikola</span> <span class="n">plugin</span> <span class="o">-</span><span class="n">i</span> <span class="n">localsearch</span>
</pre><p>It will give you a configuration sample to paste in your config.py file.</p>
